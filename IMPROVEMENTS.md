# Dashboard & Logging Improvements

## 🗑️ **Removed Redundant Traffic Sources Chart**
- ✅ Removed "Traffic Sources" chart from charts grid
- ✅ Removed JavaScript code for sources chart initialization 
- ✅ Kept "All Traffic Sources" comprehensive table with full data
- ✅ Better use of dashboard space

**Reason**: The chart only showed top 5 sources while the table shows ALL sources with more details (count, percentage, visual bars).

## 📊 **Enhanced Block Request Logging**

### ✅ **Comprehensive Data Collection**
All `block_request` logs now include:

**🔍 Query Parameters:**
- All query parameters are now logged
- No more missing UTM params, referral codes, etc.

**📄 Headers:**
- User-Agent, Referer, Accept headers
- Language and encoding preferences  
- X-Forwarded headers (IP, Proto)

**🌐 Source Information:**
- Full referrer analysis (host, path, query)
- X-Forwarded-For chain
- Direct vs referral traffic classification

### ✅ **New Helper Function**
```go
buildBlockRequestLog(c *fiber.Ctx, ip, reason string, extra map[string]interface{}) utils.LogEntry
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Consistent logging format across all block types
- ✅ Comprehensive data collection
- ✅ Better debugging capabilities
- ✅ Source tracking for blocked traffic

### ✅ **Updated Block Types:**
1. **Bad Referrer** - includes full referrer analysis
2. **Suspicious UA** - includes matched UA pattern  
3. **Rate Limit** - includes request timing info
4. **Blacklisted IP** - includes IP prefix info
5. **Geo Restrictions** - includes country code
6. **Non-Mobile** - includes device detection
